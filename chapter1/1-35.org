* Statement

Show that the golden ratio (section 1.2.2) is a fixed point of the
transformation x↦1+1/x, and use this fact to compute ϕ by means of the
fixed-point procedure.

* Solution

  Its a simple question.
  
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  (define phi
    (fixed-point (lambda (x) (+ 1 (/ 1 x))) 1.5))
#+END_SRC
 
  I defined the tolerance as $10^{-10}$ instead of $10^{-5}$.

#+begin_src racket
  (check-= (halve (+ 1 (sqrt 5))) phi 1e-10)
#+end_src

* Addendum

  Mathematically, proving it has no merit as it's practically implicit from the
  definition of φ. For example, we could use this argument:
  
  #+begin_quote
  φ is the root of the polynomial x^2 - x - 1, so φ^2 - φ - 1 = 0. This is
  equivalent to φ(φ - 1) = 1, or φ = 1 + 1/φ. Therefore, φ is the fixed point of
  the function f(x) = 1 + 1/x.
  #+end_quote
  
  Or this other (directly from the definition of the golden ratio):

  #+begin_quote
  For any pair of numbers a and b, it is said they are in /golden ratio/ if (a +
  b) / a = a/b = φ. Hence b/a = 1/φ and we have: 1+1/φ = φ.
