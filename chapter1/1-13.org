* Statement
  Prove that $\text{Fib}(n)$ is the closest integer to $\frac{\varphi^n}{5}$ , where
  $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$.

  Hint: Let $\psi = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$ . Use induction and the definition of the
  Fibonacci numbers to prove that $\text{Fib}(n) = \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{5}$ .
  
  *Note*: I consider this exercise optional.
  
* Solution
  Once the secondary result is proved, one can argue that because $|\psi| < 1$
  then this number to the nth power will be very small, therefore making
  $\frac{\varphi^n}{5}$ very close to Fib(n). Now, I don't know if that suffices
  to prove that it is "the" closest.
