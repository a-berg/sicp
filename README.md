# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This repo contains my own take on SICP, using Racket 7.6 via the `sicp` package.
The format I decided to follow is: `org` files then tangle to `rkt` file. In the
future I'd like to just have the org files and run code directly in them via
babel, but for now this suffices.
